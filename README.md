# Bookmark Stack
Sublime Text Plugin to quickly push and pop reference points called bookmarks onto a stack, allowing quick deep-diving and returning during code reviews.

## Usage
Select one or more lines, right-click and choose "Push Bookmark" to save the current reference point, and then navigate elsewhere. When you need to return to a saved reference point, right-click and select "Pop Bookmark". The number of bookmarks you can have is infinate, and you'll always return to the most recently pushed bookmark in the stack.
